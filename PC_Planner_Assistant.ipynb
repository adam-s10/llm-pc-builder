        "\n",
        "- 🛠️ **Function Calling (Tool Use)**  \n",
        "  The LLM can call external functions (`tools`) to take specific actions like searching for parts or updating the user's plan. These include both *stateful (developed-controlled)* and *stateless (automatically executed)* tools.\n",
        "\n",

        "- 📡 **Grounding with Real-Time Search**  \n",
        "  When needed, the assistant uses the Gemini + Google Search tool to fetch fresh data about prices, part availability, and task requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 📚 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  \n",
        "  For complex tasks like “What PC parts are best for 4K video editing?”, the assistant uses a local vector store (ChromaDB) to ground its answers in relevant, pre-embedded documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🧠 **Vector Search / Vector Database Integration**  \n",
        "  Embedding and indexing `.txt` documents using Gemini allows the assistant to semantically search knowledge on demand.\n",

        "- 🧭 **Autonomous Decision Routing**  \n",
        "  The LangGraph graph architecture allows the assistant to choose between multiple next steps — like planning, searching, or optimizing the PC build — based on current context.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔄 **Stateful, Multi-Turn Memory**  \n",
        "  Conversation state is maintained via LangGraph’s `PCBuilderState`, enabling coherent, long-form dialogues across multiple turns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🗣️ **Persona / Role-Adaptive Prompting**  \n",
        "  Just like the BaristaBot example, we define a robust system prompt to shape the assistant into a helpful, focused PC-building expert that avoids distractions and guides the user carefully. Moreover, well-defined prompts and instructions are included for all of the Gemini calls that are made throughout (such as for searching)."
