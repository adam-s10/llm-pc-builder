The    Overclockers UK AcademyOverclockers UK AcademyOverclockers UK AcademyOverclockers UK Academy  is back with another in-depth helpful guide all about the wonderful world of PC
hardware. 
In this blog post, we’ll be covering everything RAM related. T aking you through what exactly RAM is, all the terminology
you need to know, along with how to choose and upgrade your memory.  
What is RAM?
Before we start, let’s go back to the basics. 
RAM, or Random Access MemoryRandom Access MemoryRandom Access MemoryRandom Access Memory , is a type of volatile memory. It is responsible for temporarily storing and processing
data. As a volatile memory solution, data is only stored on the RAM whilst your PC is turned on. Once it’s turned off, all
the data is lost.  
There are a few key terms and features that you need to be aware of when it comes to selecting your PC’s memory.  
Standards:
There are several different standards of RAM, including:  
DDRDDRDDRDDR 
DDR2DDR2DDR2DDR2 
DDR3DDR3DDR3DDR3 
DDR4DDR4DDR4DDR4 
DDR5 DDR5 DDR5 DDR5   
DDR5 is the most recent of the bunch, featuring double the capacity and density of previous generations, whilst also
reducing power consumption.  
You can take a deeper look at the differences between the
DDR4 and DDR5 standards in our dedicated blog article.

Conﬁgurations:
Along with different standards, there are also multiple RAM conﬁgurations. The RAM conﬁguration refers to how many
modules you have. There are: 
Single-Channel  Single-Channel  Single-Channel  Single-Channel  
Dual-Channel Dual-Channel Dual-Channel Dual-Channel 
Quad-Channel Quad-Channel Quad-Channel Quad-Channel 
Octo-Channel  Octo-Channel  Octo-Channel  Octo-Channel  
Each type of conﬁguration boasts speciﬁc advantages for gamers, streamers, and creatives. Therefore, you’ll need to
make sure you select the right memory conﬁguration for what you need.  
Thankfully, to make it easier for you, we’ve created a
dedicated blog guide taking you through each RAM
conﬁguration.

Capacity:
The capacity of your RAM kit refers to the amount of memory it has and is often measured in Gigabytes (GBGBGBGB). The higher
this number, the greater amount of data it can store and process. You can ﬁnd RAM kits with varying different capacities,
depending on the conﬁguration. 
The most common capacities include:  
8GB8GB8GB8GB 
16GB16GB16GB16GB 
32GB32GB32GB32GB 
64GB64GB64GB64GB 
RAM Speed:
RAM speed refers to how quickly it can read your data from the CPU and is typically measured in Megahertz (MHz)(MHz)(MHz)(MHz) . The
higher the speed, the more clock cycles it can perform and the quicker it is at processing and storing your information. For
example, if your RAM is measured at 3200MHz, this means it can write at up to 3.2 billion clock cycles per second.  
Transfer Rate:
Measured in Megabytes per second (MBps)MBps)MBps)MBps) , the    transfer rate refers how to much data your RAM can transfer.  
CAS Timings:
CAS Timing is how quickly the RAM responds to your processor requesting an action/data. They are often displayed as a
set of numbers, such as 16-20-20-38, can be broken down into four different parts: 
CAS Latency (CL):CAS Latency (CL):CAS Latency (CL):CAS Latency (CL):  how quickly it takes for the RAM to have the data ready 
Row Column Delay (tRCD):Row Column Delay (tRCD):Row Column Delay (tRCD):Row Column Delay (tRCD):  how long it takes for the RAM to read this data 
Row Precharge (tRP):Row Precharge (tRP):Row Precharge (tRP):Row Precharge (tRP):  the time it takes for a new row of data to be ready 
Row Active Time (tRAS):Row Active Time (tRAS):Row Active Time (tRAS):Row Active Time (tRAS):  the minimum time it takes for a row of data to be active 
RAM Latency:
Finally, RAM latency refers to the delay in-between the transfer of data from the RAM to the processor. 
T o achieve the best possible performance, we recommend you look for a RAM kit with a low latency, but high RAM speed.
You can work out the latency by multiplying the CAS latency by 2000 and then times this by the data rate. The lower the
time is in nanoseconds (nsnsnsns), the faster the RAM is. 
For example, a RAM kit with 6000MHz and a CAS latency of 30, would reach speeds of 10ns. There are plenty of handy
online webpages that can help you work out the latency of your memory kit, such as xbitslabs RAM Speed Calculator.  
What to Consider Before Y ou Upgrade 
Now that we’ve covered all the key terms and features, let’s move on to what you need to consider before you upgrade. 
Speed vs Capacity:
When selecting your RAM kit, speed, and capacity need to be balanced. This reduces the chance of any complex
problems, such as bottlenecking or a notable drop in performance.
In addition to this, you’ll also want to take into consideration your workload and what you’ll primarily be using your PC
for.
Gaming:  
If it’s gaming, you’ll want to focus on speed.  
With most games requiring between 8GB and 16GB, we recommend a RAM kit with 32GB. This ensures you can reap all
the beneﬁts of fast, high-quality RAM, including quick response times and virtually no input lag during critical in-game
moments.  
Plus, a RAM kit with a high-rated speed can even help to enhance your FPS (frame rates per second), giving you a notable
boost whilst in-game.  
Work:
Alternatively, for work, you’ll want a hefty capacity to ensure your PC is up to the task of running multiple intensive
applications and tabs simultaneously.  
How Many Sticks of RAM Do Y ou Need?
We recommend you only buy one kit of RAM, that features the exact number of RAM modules and required
conﬁguration.  
Dual-channel or higher will perform better than single-channel as there is more than one lane for the memory to travel
across at once. Unlike single-channel, there’s no waiting for the previous request to be completed.  
However, as you increase your RAM conﬁguration, you also need to ensure that your processor and motherboard are
capable of running that type of conﬁguration. If they aren’t, you risk poor, unstable performance and will increase the risk
of a lot of problems and performance loss.  
The Silicon Lottery:
When it comes to the wonderful world of RAM, you may have heard of the phrase ‘Silicon Lottery’ , especially when it
comes to your CPU’s IMC (Integrated Memory Controller).  
The IMC is an integrated part of your processor and affects the RAM compatibility, speed, and capacity. For example, the
Intel i9 13900KS only supports up to a max RAM speed of 5600MHz, this differs slightly depending on the number of
modules you have installed.  
If you’ve brought a RAM kit rated at 7600MHz, but your processor IMC or motherboard doesn’t support these speeds,
then you won’t be able to achieve this. Before you purchase any RAM kit, we recommend that you check your
motherboard’s memory QBL or the manufacturer’s qualiﬁed vendor list. In this list, you’ll be able to see all the tested and
supported RAM kits that will work on that motherboard, with a speciﬁc CPU.  
Overclocking – XMP and EXPO:
Your RAM kit will most likely come with built-in overclocking pre-sets. These settings can alter the voltage, timings, sub-
timings, and even the speed of your RAM kit.  
The overclocking proﬁles you can ﬁnd include: 
XMP (Extreme Memory Proﬁle)XMP (Extreme Memory Proﬁle)XMP (Extreme Memory Proﬁle)XMP (Extreme Memory Proﬁle)  – allows you to overclock your memory with all Intel processors.  
DOCP (Direct Overclocking Proﬁle)DOCP (Direct Overclocking Proﬁle)DOCP (Direct Overclocking Proﬁle)DOCP (Direct Overclocking Proﬁle)  – made by ASUS, allows you to overlock your memory on AMD motherboards. 
EOCP (Extended Overclocking Proﬁle)EOCP (Extended Overclocking Proﬁle)EOCP (Extended Overclocking Proﬁle)EOCP (Extended Overclocking Proﬁle)  – made by Gigabyte, also allows you to overclock your memory on AMD
motherboards.  
EXPOEXPOEXPOEXPO (Extended Proﬁles for Overclocking) (Extended Proﬁles for Overclocking) (Extended Proﬁles for Overclocking) (Extended Proﬁles for Overclocking)  – AMD’s alternate to XMP and can be used with AMD processors. 
All high-powered RAM kits utilise these pre-set proﬁles and have to be manually turned on in your motherboard’s BIOS.
You don’t have to enable them in your BIOS, but if you don’t, your memory will simply perform at its stock speeds. 
Before you adjust any settings by overclocking, we do recommend that you check your hardware’s manufacturer’s
warranty.  
A Few Final Thoughts
We’ve shared a whole lot of information throughout this blog post, so we’ve decided to keep it short and sweet at the end
by giving you a little rundown. 
Ultimately, before you upgrade your RAM you need to check both your motherboard and processor’s speciﬁcation to
ensure its compatible. Utilise the QBL or vendor list for tested and compatible RAM kits with your chosen components.  
What’s more, you need to consider what’s more important to you. Do you want ultra-fast speeds or hefty capacities?
What you choose will all depend on this.  
Selecting the perfect RAM kit for your gaming PC helps to ensure optimal performance, allowing you to focus on the
more important things. That is, of course, exploring your favourite gaming worlds or defeating your enemies in some one-
on-one high stakes combat.
